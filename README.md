# Closest To Zero

Given a Python iterable of positive and negative integers, it returns the closest number to zero. 
If the closest number in input could be either negative or positive, the function returns the positive one.
If the input array is undefined or empty, the function returns 0.

The repo is composed of several files :
* closest_to_zero.py, which contains the function
* README.md
* requirements.txt, that specifies the dependencies and help create a correct execution environment
* unit_test.py, a unit testing file

## Execution Environnement
This project uses Python 3.7.3. If you encounter a problem running it, then installing the dependencies with ```pip install -r requirements.txt ``` should solve it.

## Tests
To run the tests, run ```pytest``` at the root, and it will call unit_test.py, containing 8 tests.
